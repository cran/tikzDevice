Version 0.4.8: Beta

STATUS:
    The tikzDevice implements the tikz() graphics driver in R. This driver
    is currently complete to the extent that all skeleton routines have been
    implemented. The device passes the plot(1,1) test.  Currently the device 
    supports colors, line types, line weights, semi-transparency, line endings 
    and line joining. 

    String width and character metrics are calculated by direct calls to a 
    LaTeX compiler. This is an inefficient but robust method. Some of the 
    inefficiency of this method is compensated for by storing calculated 
    string widths in a database managed by the filehash package. This way if 
    we pay a computational price to compute the width of a string, we 
    hopefully only pay it once.

FIX:
    * Fill colors are still shown for polylines and lines; This does not 
      affect the output but is inefficient.  
      
    * Line endings are still shown for circles and squares; This does not 
      affect the output but is inefficient.

TODO:
    

FIXED:
    * Polylines are filled as white
        [Solution]
        Added a parameter tikzInfo->polyLine that is set to TRUE when StyleDef 
        is called, the fill color is only set if tikzInfo->polyLine == FALSE
        
    * Shapes are plotted with a default color border of black when it should 
      be transparent
        [Solution]
        See the solution below.
  
    * The CheckAndSetAlpha() function provides inconsistent results for 
      example test3 is completely transparent but test4 is not though.
        [Solution]
        Allowed for the option to set fill and draw transparency separately 
        with an extra parameter to CheckAndSetAlpha()
  
    * Fill and draw colors are redefined before every shape is drawn, this 
      works as a first cut but is VERY inefficient for large numbers of points 
      which are not changing colors. possibly use \begin{scope}\end{scope} if 
      possible
        [Solution]
        Introduced the parameters oldFillColor and oldDrawColor in the 
        tikzInfo structure which are checked against the current color and 
        only redefined if different 
    
    * when using plot(1,1), all calls to text result in proper output with one
      exception: the coordinates of the text nodes are nan.
        [Solution]
        This error occurred because TikZ_Setup neglected to set the initial  
        size of the font by assigning a value to startps inside the device 
        structure. Additionally, plot characters were not produced because the 
        initial foreground and background colors were not set.

    * when using plot(1,1), the bounding box of the plot is almost drawn 
      correctly. The line travels through the correct points, then returns to 
      (0,0) which results in the right hand side of the plot having a funky 
      edge.
        [Solution]
        This bug was a result of incorrect handling of C's #&@!&^ 0 array 
        indexing by TikZ_Polyline.

    * When using plot(1,1), all text labels are placed incorrectly. This may
      be a result of neglecting to provide a serious attempt at calculating
      string width.
        [Solution]
        This was indeed a result of not making an attempt to calculate 
        the width of LaTeX strings. This has been fixed by a somewhat 
        elaborate system call to the LaTeX compiler. This would be an 
        elegent solution except for the fact that we have to call the 
        compiler 100s of times...

    * Adding legends to plots results in incorrect sizing and positioning.
      See lengend test for an example of this behavoir.
        [Solution]
        This was caused be not implementing a full metricInfo function. 
        Basically labels in legends seemd to hang below the symbols they 
        were plotted next to. This was caused by returning fixed ascents 
        and descents that were too large. Now LaTeX is called and the 
        character in question is set into a named TikZ node, say A. The 
        ascent is calculated by TikZ as:
        
          A.north - A.base
        
        The descent as:
        
          A.base - A.south
        
        And the width as:
        
          A.east - A.west
